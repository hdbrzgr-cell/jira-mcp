# Git Commit Standards

Follow these guidelines when making commits to the Jira MCP project.

## Commit Message Format

Use the following format for commit messages:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (formatting, etc.)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Scope

The scope should specify the part of the codebase affected (e.g., tool, service, util).

Examples:
- `feat(issue-tool)`: Add new issue tool functionality
- `fix(jira-client)`: Fix authentication issue in Jira client
- `docs(readme)`: Update installation instructions

### Subject

- Use the imperative mood ("Add" not "Added")
- Don't capitalize the first letter
- No period at the end

### Body

- Use to explain what and why vs. how
- Include motivation for the change and contrast with previous behavior

### Footer

- Reference issues and pull requests
- Note breaking changes with "BREAKING CHANGE:" prefix

## Best Practices

1. Keep commits focused on a single logical change
2. Write meaningful commit messages that explain why the change was made
3. Include relevant issue numbers (e.g., "Fixes #123")
4. Run tests before committing
5. Follow Go code style guidelines

## Example Commits

```
feat(search-tool): add support for JQL escaping

Improve JQL query handling by properly escaping special characters.
This prevents syntax errors when users input special characters in search queries.

Fixes #45
```

```
fix(auth): handle expired tokens gracefully

When a token expires, the system now detects the 401 response and
provides a clear error message instead of crashing.

Closes #78
```
