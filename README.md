# Jira MCP

A Go-based MCP (Model Control Protocol) connector for Jira that enables AI assistants like Claude to interact with Atlassian Jira. This tool provides a seamless interface for AI models to perform common Jira operations.

## WHY

While Atlassian provides an official MCP connector, our implementation offers **superior flexibility and real-world problem-solving capabilities**. We've built this connector to address the daily challenges developers and project managers actually face, not just basic API operations.

**Key Advantages:**
- **More Comprehensive Tools**: We provide 20+ specialized tools covering every aspect of Jira workflow management
- **Real-World Focus**: Built to solve actual daily problems like sprint management, issue relationships, and workflow transitions
- **Enhanced Flexibility**: Support for complex operations like moving issues between sprints, creating child issues, and managing issue relationships
- **Better Integration**: Seamless integration with AI assistants for natural language Jira operations
- **Practical Design**: Tools designed for actual development workflows, not just basic CRUD operations

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:
1. **Local Jira 10.3.2** instance running and accessible
2. **Personal Access Token (PAT)** from your local Jira instance
3. **Cursor IDE** with Claude integration

### Step 1: Get Your Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. **Log into your local Jira 10.3.2** instance
2. **Go to Settings** ‚Üí **Personal Access Tokens** (or navigate to `/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?selectedTab=com.atlassian.pat.jira:personal-access-tokens`)
3. Click **"Create token"**
4. Give it a name like "Jira MCP Connector"
5. **Select appropriate permissions** (at minimum: Browse Projects, Create Issues, Edit Issues, Add Comments)
6. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)

### Step 2: Choose Your Installation Method

#### üì¶ Option A: Download Binary (Recommended)

1. Go to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/hdbrzgr/jira-mcp/releases)
2. Download for your platform:
   - **macOS**: `jira-mcp_darwin_amd64`
   - **Linux**: `jira-mcp_linux_amd64`  
   - **Windows**: `jira-mcp_windows_amd64.exe`
3. Make it executable (macOS/Linux):
   ```bash
   chmod +x jira-mcp_*
   sudo mv jira-mcp_* /usr/local/bin/jira-mcp
   ```

#### üõ†Ô∏è Option B: Build from Source

```bash
go install github.com/hdbrzgr/jira-mcp/v2@latest
```

### Step 3: Configure Cursor

1. **Open Cursor**
2. **Go to Settings** ‚Üí **Features** ‚Üí **Model Context Protocol**
3. **Add a new MCP server** with this configuration:

#### Configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jira": {
      "command": "$GO_PATH/bin/jira-mcp",
      "env": {
        "JIRA_HOST": "http://localhost:8080",
        "JIRA_PAT": "your-personal-access-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Test Your Setup

1. **Restart Cursor** completely
2. **Open a new chat** with Claude
3. **Try these test commands**:

```
List my Jira projects
```

```
Show me issues assigned to me
```

```
What's in the current sprint?
```

If you see Jira data, **congratulations! üéâ** You're all set up.

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Using Environment Files

Create a `.env` file for easier management:

```bash
# .env file
JIRA_HOST=http://localhost:8080
JIRA_PAT=your-personal-access-token
```

Then use it:
```bash
# With binary
jira-mcp -env .env
```

### HTTP Mode for Development

For development and testing, you can run in HTTP mode:

```bash
# Start HTTP server on port 3000
jira-mcp -env .env -http_port 3000
```

Then configure Cursor with:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jira": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## üéØ Usage Examples

Once configured, you can ask Claude to help with Jira tasks using natural language:

### Issue Management
- *"Create a new bug ticket for the login issue"*
- *"Show me details for ticket PROJ-123"*
- *"Move ticket PROJ-456 to In Progress"*
- *"Add a comment to PROJ-789 saying the fix is ready"*

### Sprint Management  
- *"What's in our current sprint?"*
- *"Move these 3 tickets to the next sprint: PROJ-1, PROJ-2, PROJ-3"*
- *"Show me all tickets assigned to John in the current sprint"*

### Reporting & Analysis
- *"Show me all bugs created this week"*
- *"List all tickets that are blocked"*
- *"What tickets are ready for testing?"*

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**‚ùå "Connection failed" or "Authentication error"**
- Double-check your `JIRA_HOST` (should be like `http://localhost:8080` for local Jira)
- Verify your Personal Access Token (PAT) is correct
- Make sure your PAT has the necessary permissions in Jira

**‚ùå "No MCP servers found"**
- Restart Cursor completely after adding the configuration
- Check the MCP configuration syntax in Cursor settings
- Verify the binary path is correct (for binary installations)

**‚ùå "Permission denied" errors**
- Make sure your Jira user account has access to the projects
- Check if your Personal Access Token has the necessary permissions

### Getting Help

1. **Check the logs**: Run with `-http_port` to see detailed error messages
2. **Test your credentials**: Run the binary with your credentials to verify connectivity
3. **Verify Cursor config**: The app will show you the exact configuration to use
